HTML & CSS Day1


1. Introduction to HTML:
   
    Question:a Create a simple HTML document that displays the text "Hello, World!" in the browser.

    Ans: 
    <!DOCTYPE html>
    <html lang="en">
    <head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>Document</title>
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="./style.css">
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/font-awesome/6.6.0/css/all.min.css" integrity="sha512-Kc323vGBEqzTmouAECnVceyQqyqdsSiqLQISBL29aUW4U/M7pSPA/gEUZQqv1cwx4OnYxTxve5UMg5GT6L4JJg==" crossorigin="anonymous" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" />
    </head>
    <body>
      <p>Hello world!</p>
    </body>
    </html>


    Question:b Explain the purpose of the <meta> tag in the <head> section of an HTML document.

    Ans: The <meta> tag in the <head> section of an HTML document provides metadata, which is information about the HTML document itself.
     Metadata is not displayed on the page but is essential for browsers, search engines, and web crawlers to understand and interpret 
     the webpage content correctly.

         b1: <meta charset="UTF-8"> : This declares that the webpage uses UTF-8 encoding, which supports many international characters.
         b2: <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"> : This tells the browser to scale the page to the
          width of the device’s screen, making it mobile-friendly.
         b3: <meta http-equiv="refresh" content="30">: This refreshes the page every 30 seconds.
  



2. HTML Document Structure:


    Question:a What does the DOCTYPE declaration <!DOCTYPE html> indicate, and why is it important?

    Ans: The <!DOCTYPE html> declaration at the beginning of an HTML document indicates the document type and helps browsers
     understand which version of HTML the webpage is written in. Specifically, <!DOCTYPE html> declares that the document is
     written in HTML5, the latest version of HTML.


     Question:b What is the ‘class' attribute in HTML?

     Ans:The class attribute in HTML is used to define a group or "class" of elements that can share the same style or behavior.
      It helps in identifying elements on the webpage so that they can be targeted with CSS for styling.


3. HTML Elements and Tags:
   
   Question:a Do all HTML tags have an end tag?
   Ans: No, not all HTML tags require an end tag. HTML tags can be categorized into two types based on whether they need an end tag:
    self-closing tags (void elements) and non-self-closing tags (which require both opening and closing tags).


        a1. self-closing tags(void elements): These tags do not have content, and therefore, they don't require a closing tag.
            ex: <img> <br>,<hr>,<meta>,<input> etc...
     
       a2. Non-Self-Closing Tags:: hese tags require both an opening tag and a corresponding closing tag.
         ex:<div></div>,<p></p>,<h1></h1> etc...


   Question:b What is the role of the <head> tag in HTML?

   Ans: The <head> tag in HTML plays a critical role in defining metadata and other resources related to the HTML document.
   It is located at the top of the HTML file, right below the <!DOCTYPE> declaration, and it contains information that is 
   not displayed directly on the webpage but is essential for the document's functionality, behavior, and optimization.


   Question:c What is the role of the <meta> tag in HTML?

   Ans: The <meta> tag in the <head> section of an HTML document provides metadata, which is information about the HTML document itself.
     Metadata is not displayed on the page but is essential for browsers, search engines, and web crawlers to understand and interpret 
     the webpage content correctly.

         b1: <meta charset="UTF-8"> : This declares that the webpage uses UTF-8 encoding, which supports many international characters.
         b2: <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"> : This tells the browser to scale the page to the
          width of the device’s screen, making it mobile-friendly.
         b3: <meta http-equiv="refresh" content="30">: This refreshes the page every 30 seconds.
  



4. HTML Attributes:
   

   Question:a Enhance a hyperlink to open in a new tab when clicked using an HTML attribute.

   Ans:  To enhance a hyperlink so that it opens in a new tab when clicked, you can use the target attribute in the <a> 
   (anchor) tag and set its value to _blank. This tells the browser to open the linked page in a new tab or window.


   <a href="https://www.example.com" target="_blank">Visit Example</a>

  Question:b Implement an image element with an alt attribute to ensure accessibility.

  Ans: To implement an accessible image element in HTML, use the <img> tag along with the alt attribute. The alt attribute provides
   alternative text that describes the image, which is crucial for accessibility, particularly for visually impaired users who rely
    on screen readers.

  <img src="image.jpg" alt="A description of the image">


 Question:c What is the difference between the ‘id' and ‘class' attributes of HTML elements?
 
 Ans:The id and class attributes in HTML are both used to assign identifiers to elements, but they serve different purposes and 
 have distinct characteristics:-


 ID:  The id attribute is unique within an HTML document. Each element can have only one id, and no two elements can share the
  same id value. This makes id ideal for targeting a single, specific element.

  <div id="header">This is the header</div>


 CLASS: The class attribute is reusable. Multiple elements can share the same class, allowing you to apply the same styles or
  behaviors to a group of elements. An element can also have multiple classes. 
   
   <div class="menu">This is a menu</div>
   <p class="menu">This is another menu item</p>



5. Text Formatting Tags (e.g., <h1>, <p>, <strong>, <em>):

Ans: HTML provides various text formatting tags that help structure and style the content of web pages. These tags define how
 the text should be displayed, offering various styling options for headings, paragraphs, emphasis, and other elements.


 1. <h1> to <h6> (Headings)
  These tags define headings, from <h1> (the most important/large heading) to <h6> (the least important/smallest heading).
  <h1>Main Heading</h1>
  <h2>Subheading</h2>


  2. <p> (Paragraph)
    The <p> tag is used to define a block of text as a paragraph. Browsers automatically add some margin or padding around paragraphs.
    <p>This is a paragraph of text.</p>


  3.<strong> (Bold Text)

   The <strong> tag is used to emphasize text, displaying it in bold. It indicates that the enclosed text has strong importance.
   <p>This is <strong>important</strong> text.</p>


  4.<b> (Bold Text)

   Similar to <strong>, the <b> tag makes text bold, but without implying any special importance. 
   <p>This is <b>bold</b> text.</p>


 5.<i> (Italicized Text)
   Similar to <em>, the <i> tag italicizes text, but without indicating emphasis or stress.
   <p>This is <i>italicized</i> text.</p>


 6.<u> (Underlined Text)

   The <u> tag is used to underline text.
   p>This is <u>underlined</u> text.</p>  


  7. <mark> (Highlighted Text)

The <mark> tag highlights text with a yellow background, indicating marked or highlighted text.
<p>This is <mark>highlighted</mark> text.</p>


8.<del> (Strikethrough Text)
The <del> tag renders text with a strikethrough to show that it has been deleted.
<p>This is <del>struck-through</del> text.</p>


9. <sup> (Superscript)

This tag displays text in superscript, often used for footnotes or mathematical notations.
E = mc<sup>2</sup>


10. <sub> (Subscript)
This tag displays text in subscript, often used for chemical formulas or mathematical equations.
H<sub>2</sub>O
