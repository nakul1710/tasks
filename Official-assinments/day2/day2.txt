1. Creating Hyperlinks (<a> element):

 Question:1a Explain the purpose of the <a> element in HTML and how it is used to create hyperlinks.

 Ans: The <a> (anchor) element in HTML is primarily used to create hyperlinks, allowing users to navigate between different
  web pages, sections within the same page, or other resources such as documents or email addresses.
 
  Purpose of the <a> Element:
  The <a> element is crucial for enabling navigation across the web. It links content to URLs (Uniform Resource Locators), facilitating
  movement from one resource to another.

Question:1b How can you differentiate between an external link and an internal link using the <a> element?

Ans: 
1. External Link:An external link directs the user to a resource on a different website.
The href value for an external link usually includes a full URL starting with http://, https://, or another protocol
 like ftp://.
  ex- <a href="https://www.example.com">External Link</a>


 2. Internal Link: An internal link directs the user to a resource within the same website or domain.
 ex-<a href="/about.html">Internal Link</a>
 
Question:1c Create a navigation menu with links to three different sections of a single page using anchors.
  Ans: answer was in day2.html



2. Linking to Other Web Pages:

Question: What is the difference between an absolute and relative URL?
Ans:The difference between absolute and relative URLs lies in the way they reference web resources:
1. Absolute URL:
 An absolute URL contains the full path to a resource, starting from the protocol (http:// or https://), the domain name, and the
 specific file path.
 It is a complete address that works independently of the current location of the document. 
eg: <a href="https://www.example.com/images/picture.jpg">View Image</a>



2. Relative URL:
A relative URL specifies a resource relative to the current document's location. It does not contain the protocol or domain and only
 references the file path within the website.
 eg: <a href="/images/picture.jpg">View Image</a>


3. Linking to Email Addresses:

Ans: Answer is at day2.html

4.Linking to Files (PDFs, Images, etc.):

Question:4a Develop a page that has a link to download a sample PDF document. The link should open the PDF in a new tab.

Ans: 
<a href="sample.pdf" target="_blank" download="SampleDocument.pdf">
        Download Sample PDF
 </a>


5. Creating Anchors (<a> with name or id attributes):

Question:5a Compare and contrast using the name attribute and the id attribute when creating anchors for linking within a page.
 Which one is preferred in modern HTML?
ANS: The name and id attributes were both historically used to create anchors for linking to specific sections of a webpage, but
 they have different purposes and usage, especially in modern HTML.

 1. name Attribute:
The name attribute was originally used with the <a> element to create named anchors for linking within a page.

<a name="section1"></a>

The name attribute specifically worked with the <a> tag to create a location to which you could link, but it only worked for anchors.

Deprecated: In modern HTML (since HTML5), the name attribute for anchors has been deprecated, meaning it is no longer recommended for
 use, though it might still work in older browsers.

2.id Attribute:
The id attribute can be used with any HTML element to create an anchor point.

<h2 id="section1">Section 1</h2>

The id attribute must be unique within the document, meaning no two elements on the same page can share the same id.

You can link to an element using id by referencing it in an anchor (href="#section1"), and it works across all HTML elements, making
 it more versatile.

It is the preferred method in modern HTML for creating anchors for internal linking.


Questions:5b Design a simple website with a navigation menu that links to an "About," "Portfolio," and "Contact" page.
Ans: Answer at day2.html


6.Creating Navigation Menus:

Question: What are the advantages of using an unordered list (<ul>) to create a navigation menu instead of simply styling individual links?
Ans: Using an unordered list (<ul>) to create a navigation menu in HTML has several advantages over simply styling individual links
 (<a> elements). Here are the key benefits:

1. Semantic Structure:
Improved Accessibility: Screen readers and assistive technologies can better interpret a navigation menu when it is structured as a list.
 A <ul> provides a clear, hierarchical structure that indicates the items are part of a group, improving accessibility for users with 
 disabilities.

SEO (Search Engine Optimization): Search engines prioritize well-structured and semantically correct HTML. Using a <ul> for navigation 
helps search engines understand that the links are part of a related navigation group.


2. Organized Markup:
Easier to Manage: A <ul> provides an easy-to-manage way to group navigation items, especially when dealing with complex menus or
 multiple levels (such as dropdowns or sub-menus). This makes the code more maintainable.


Consistent Styling: When using a <ul>, you can apply styles to all menu items (inside <li> tags) uniformly, making it easier
 to control appearance, padding, spacing, and alignment.


7. Ordered and Unordered List:

Question:7a Differentiate between an Ordered list and an Unordered list? Explain with example.

1. Ordered List (<ol>):
An ordered list displays items in a specific sequence, with numbers, letters, or Roman numerals automatically added before each
item to indicate the order.
Use Case: When the order or sequence of items matters, such as in step-by-step instructions or rankings.
EX:
<ol>
   <li>First item</li>
   <li>Second item</li>
   <li>Third item</li>
</ol>
O/P:
1.First item
2.Second item
3.Third item


2. Unordered List (<ul>):
An unordered list displays items without any particular order. Instead of numbers, each item is preceded by a bullet point (default)
or a custom marker.
Use Case: When the order of items does not matter, such as when listing features, ingredients, or options.
Ex:
<ul>
   <li>Apples</li>
   <li>Bananas</li>
   <li>Cherries</li>
</ul>


O/P:
.Apples
.Bananas
.Cherries


Question:7b What are the different types of lists in HTML?

Ans: Different types of lists-
  1.Ordered List (<ol>)
  2.Unordered List (<ul>)
  3.Description List (<dl>)
